# Tomography Alignment
Rigid body alignment for x-ray tomography data

# Installation

To simply install the package `tomoalign` from [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) as an editable package, please do:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Alternatively, you can install this package with [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) in a dedicated virtual environment as:

```bash
poetry install
```

To activate this virtual environment simply type `poetry shell` (at repository's root folder) and to deactive the environment `deactivate`.


## Fortran code compilation

After installation of the dependencies, this step wraps the relevant fortran code by using the `numpy.f2py` utility. This is done by compiling the sources and building an extension module containing the wrappers.

Assuming you are at the repository's root folder execute this bash file (ignore the warning messages):

```bash
bash f2py.sh
```
